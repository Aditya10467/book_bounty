# book_bounty

Book Bounty is a user-friendly app that provides a platform for people to donate books, while also enabling those who are looking for books to request them. The app is a great way to foster a sense of community by bringing together individuals who share a passion for reading and who want to help others access the knowledge and enjoyment that books can provide.
